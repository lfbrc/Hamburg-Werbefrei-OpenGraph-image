# Hamburg Werbefrei - OpenGraph image template to automatically share images in networks and messengers

This is a simple template for embedding images when sharing links.

## About This Repository

This repository is the place where a test page for the implementation of images via OpenGraph tags is provided as an example.

### How to use

Copy the OpenGraph tags into the head section of your HTML page.

#### Brief explanation:

* og:image = absolute path to the image to be displayed when sharing

* og:image:width/height = self-explanatory

* g:url = absolute path to the page to be shared

* og:title = the subject that is to be displayed

* og:description = introductory text

* All other tags are recommended, but optional

### Notes

Set the all urls to an absolute address on the corresponding web server - the messenger and sharing sites access this information externally.
